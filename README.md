Analysis on EV batteries durability using the Nissan LEAF as a case study. As battery electric vehicles (BEV) are increasingly being considered as an economic option to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE), we take a look into the reports of Nissan LEAF owners regarding the battery capacity, mileage and range.

Plug In America Leaf Battery Survey Data
I gathered data on the age, mileage and battery capacity bars of Nissan LEAF cars from Plug In Americaâ€™s surveys, in which car owners around the world self-report real-life vehicle stats. This data covers LEAFs built between 2011 and 2019, of various age and mileage. I then analysed the information which covered over a thousand entries across 647 vehicles, in order to understand the relationship between battery capacity bars and the age and mileage of a battery electric vehicle (BEV).

EV batteries will deteriorate with time at different rates
647 vehicles reported from 2011 to 2019 model year.
Outliers
I found statistical outliers in the survey data and used the IQC method
How does range change over the first few years of car ownership?
Exploratory Analysis of Surveys from Plug In America
  Half of surveys are from 2011 Nissan LEAF model which gives us most span of years
  Capacity bars vs perceived range
